# Capston Project

Welcome to the project section. In this section you'll find upto 100 projects with there solution.
This section you have to carry out for yourself. Because to learn any coding language you should have the grasp over the algorithum and
that what you'll get via **practising** code abd making small applications.
**Try to do it yourself first and if got stucked take help from internet, use solution only if there's nothing left.**

Thank you and enjoy the course!
