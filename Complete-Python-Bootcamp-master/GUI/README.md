# Introduction to GUIs
## Welcome to the GUI Section of this course!
There are many, many Graphical User Interface options for Python users.
Here is the link to the documentation concerning the [most common GUI frameworks.](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GUI%20Programming%20in%20Python)
For a full list of all available GUI frameworks, check out the [Full GUI Programming List](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming)
It's important to remember that no framework is objectively better than all the others, and different use cases will require different frameworks. For instance, if you want to begin GUIs by designing a graphical game, your best bet would be PyGame! (The link provided directs you to there learning page).
If you want to build web apps, you'll probably want to avoid Python as the GUI and use it for backend work using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) instead. With web apps you'll want to explore HTML,CSS, and Javascript to provide the GUI for your user.
**For the rest of this section we will explore the awesome world of Widgets in the Jupyter Notebook setting! This type of GUI is best suited for creating dashboards for data/business analysis situations.**

Let's get started!

**Please follow the sequence from 1 to 6.**
